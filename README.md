## How to contribute an implementation (code)?
* Have a look at open issues. They contain the list of algorithms/DS we plan to be implemented. Pick an unassigned issue.
* You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.
* **Make sure you are assigned for the issue.**
* Code the algorithm/DS.
* Send a PR
* Be sure to not include any compiled binaries in the patch.
* While sending a PR make sure you follow one issue per PR rule.

Q.25: RUNNING TIME AND COMPLEXITY
Objective -
Today we're learning about running time! 
Task - 
A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Given a number,n, determine and print whether it's Prime or Not.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a Oâˆšn primality algorithm, 
or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm.
Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!
